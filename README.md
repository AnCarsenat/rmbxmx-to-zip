# rmbxmx-to-zip

Hi there,
When triying to converse with chatGPT and have him debug my code,
I ran into the issue of having to give him alot of info about my workspace
Hence the reason of creating a programm that will convert rbxmx=>zip/folder

<h3>Rbxmx ==> Folder</h3>


<h3>How to use</h3>
It will be written in Python, using XML
And will have a version builded into an EXE file for easy access
